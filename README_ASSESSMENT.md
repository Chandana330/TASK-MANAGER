# Task Management System - Assessment Solution

## Overview
This is a full-stack task management system built for the Associate Software Engineer assessment at Better Software. The application features task management with comment functionality, following proper CRUD principles and software engineering best practices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Edge Functions, Authentication)
- **State Management**: React hooks with Supabase real-time capabilities
- **UI Components**: Customized shadcn/ui components with semantic design tokens

## Assessment Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task #1: Backend APIs for Comment CRUD Operations
**Location**: `supabase/functions/comments/index.ts`

Implemented a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

#### 1. **GET /comments?task_id={id}**
- Fetches all comments for a specific task
- Returns comments ordered by creation date
- **Validation**: Requires `task_id` parameter

#### 2. **POST /comments**
- Creates a new comment for a task
- **Validation**:
  - `content` and `task_id` are required
  - Content cannot be empty (after trimming)
  - Content must be less than 1000 characters
  - User must be authenticated
- **Security**: Automatically associates comment with authenticated user

#### 3. **PUT /comments?id={id}**
- Updates an existing comment
- **Validation**:
  - `id` and `content` are required
  - Content cannot be empty (after trimming)
  - Content must be less than 1000 characters
- **Security**: RLS policies ensure users can only update their own comments

#### 4. **DELETE /comments?id={id}**
- Deletes a comment
- **Validation**: Requires `id` parameter
- **Security**: RLS policies ensure users can only delete their own comments

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Proper CRUD operations
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Error handling with descriptive messages
- ✅ CORS support for web applications
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- ✅ Automated tests (see `supabase/functions/comments/test.ts`)

### ✅ Task #2 (Bonus): Frontend Interface
**Location**: `src/pages/`, `src/components/`

#### Features Implemented:

1. **Authentication System** (`src/components/AuthForm.tsx`)
   - Email/password signup and login
   - Auto-confirm email for development
   - Persistent sessions
   - Secure sign-out

2. **Task Management** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/components/TaskCard.tsx`)
   - View all tasks in a responsive grid layout
   - Create new tasks with title, description, status, and priority
   - Edit existing tasks
   - Delete tasks
   - Visual status and priority badges
   - Empty state for new users

3. **Comment System** (`src/components/CommentList.tsx`, etc.)
   - Add comments to tasks
   - View all comments for a task
   - Edit comments (inline editing with dialog)
   - Delete comments
   - Timestamp display (relative time format)
   - Character count validation (max 1000 chars)

4. **Design System**
   - Professional blue color scheme
   - Semantic color tokens for consistency
   - Success, warning, and destructive variants
   - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
   - Accessible UI components

## Database Schema

### Tasks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed')),
  priority TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium' CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
```

### Comments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  task_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);
```

## Security Implementation

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Tasks**:
- Users can only view, create, update, and delete their own tasks
- All operations are scoped to `auth.uid()`

**Comments**:
- Users can view comments on their own tasks
- Users can create comments on their own tasks
- Users can only update/delete their own comments
- Prevents unauthorized access to other users' data

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated on both client and server
- Content length limits enforced
- Empty content detection after trimming
- Type checking for all parameters

## Testing

### Automated Backend Tests
**Location**: `supabase/functions/comments/test.ts`

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Create comment with valid data
- ✅ Validate required fields
- ✅ Validate empty content
- ✅ Validate content length (max 1000 chars)
- ✅ Fetch comments for a task
- ✅ Validate required parameters
- ✅ Update comment
- ✅ Delete comment
- ✅ Invalid HTTP methods
- ✅ CORS headers

**To run tests**:
```bash
deno test --allow-net --allow-env supabase/functions/comments/test.ts
```

## Key Engineering Decisions

1. **Backend Architecture**: Used Supabase Edge Functions instead of Flask
   - **Reasoning**: The Lovable platform provides native Supabase integration, allowing for faster development and automatic deployment. Edge Functions provide the same RESTful API capabilities with built-in authentication.

2. **Single Edge Function for Comments**: Handled all CRUD operations in one function
   - **Reasoning**: Reduces deployment complexity and keeps related operations together. The function uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to differentiate operations.

3. **Client-Side Rendering**: React with client-side routing
   - **Reasoning**: Better user experience with instant page transitions and no full page reloads.

4. **Row-Level Security**: Leveraged Postgres RLS for data protection
   - **Reasoning**: Database-level security is more robust than application-level checks and prevents data leaks even if application code has bugs.

5. **Component Architecture**: Small, focused components
   - **Reasoning**: Better maintainability, reusability, and testability. Each component has a single responsibility.

6. **Design System**: Semantic tokens and variant-based styling
   - **Reasoning**: Ensures visual consistency and makes it easy to change the theme across the entire application.

## Trade-offs and Technical Debt

1. **No Frontend Tests**: Focused on backend API tests as required by Task #1
   - **Future improvement**: Add React Testing Library tests for components

2. **Basic Authentication**: Email/password only, no OAuth providers
   - **Future improvement**: Add Google, GitHub OAuth

3. **No Real-time Updates**: Comments don't update automatically when other users add them
   - **Future improvement**: Implement Supabase real-time subscriptions

4. **Simple Error Handling**: Generic error messages in some cases
   - **Future improvement**: More specific error messages and better error recovery

5. **No Pagination**: All tasks and comments loaded at once
   - **Future improvement**: Implement pagination for better performance with large datasets

6. **Test Data Setup**: Tests require manual setup of mock IDs
   - **Future improvement**: Create test fixtures and seed data

## Running the Application

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account with email and password
2. **Add Tasks**: Click "Add Task" to create new tasks
3. **Manage Tasks**: Edit status, priority, or delete tasks
4. **Add Comments**: Click "Add Comment" on any task
5. **View Comments**: Click "View Comments" to see all comments for a task
